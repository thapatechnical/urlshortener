// How It Works:
// This middleware runs on every request before reaching the route handlers.
//? res.locals is an object that persists throughout the request-response cycle.
//? If req.user exists (typically from authentication, like Passport.js), it's stored in res.locals.user.
//? Views (like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars) can directly access user without manually passing it in every route.

// express router
// app.use(router);
app.use(authRoutes);
app.use(shortenerRoutes);
